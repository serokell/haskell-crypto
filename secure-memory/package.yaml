synopsis: Securely allocated and deallocated memory.
description: |
  Securely allocated and deallocated memory.

  When handling sensitive data in your program, you want to be extra
  careful and make sure that it is gone as soon as you are done working
  with it. In a garbage-collected language like Haskell this is not so easy,
  since the garbage collector can move your bytes around and create copies
  of it. In addition to that, even if the memory gets eventually deallocated,
  it is not guaranteed that the data will actually be zeroed-out or overriden.

  To make matters even worse, if the operating system runs out of RAM while
  your sensitive data remains in the memory, the page that contains your data
  can get swapped out and, thus, end up on the disk, which you, of course,
  absolutely want to never happen.

  This library provides a (relatively) easy to use interface for working
  with data allocated in a secure memory location that is guaranteed to never
  end up on the disk and that will be zeroed-out as soon as you finish using it.
