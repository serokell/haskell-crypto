-- | A constraint for functions that require access to secure memory.

type WithSecureMemory = Given SodiumInitialised


-- | This function performs the initialisation steps
-- required for allocating data in secure memory regions.
--
-- The basic usage is to call this function and provide to it
-- a block of code that will be allocating memory for sensitive
-- data. The type of 'withSensitiveBytes' is such that it can
-- only be called withing such a code block.
--
-- Ideally, you should call 'withSecureMemory' only once and deal
-- with all your sensitive data within this single code block,
-- however it is not a requirement â€“ you can call it as many
-- times as you wish and the only downside to doing so is that
-- it will incur a tiny performance penalty.
--
-- In some rare circumstances this function secure memory initialisation
-- may fail, in which case this function will throw
-- 'SecureMemoryInitException'.

--

-- This function guarantees that:
--
-- 1. The garbage collector will not touch the allocated memory and
--    will not try to copy the sensitive data.
-- 2. The memory will be zeroed-out and freed as soon as the computation
--    finishes.
--
-- Additionally, it will try its best (subject to the support from
-- the operating system) to do the following:
--
-- 1. Allocate the buffer at the end of a page and make sure that the
--    following page is not mapped, so trying to access past the end of
--    the buffer will crash the program.
-- 2. Place a canary immediately before the buffer, check that it was not
--    modified before deallocating the memory, and crash the program otherwise.
-- 3. @mlock@ the memory to make sure it will not be paged to the disk.
-- 4. Ask the operating system not to include this memory in core dumps.
--
-- Just as with regular @malloc@, allocation can fail, for example,
-- if there is not enough memory. In this case, the function will throw
-- 'SensitiveBytesAllocException'.
